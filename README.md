# 🎩 Profile pictures! (featuring Redis!)

The previous version of this, made by [sampoder](https://github.com/sampoder) used a S1 DB, which I now made to use Redis, so I could selfhost this easier. I also added some more silly features (including a privacy policy and a country indicator!)

Just set a SLACK_TOKEN and a REDIS_URL to your .env, upload some images, and you should be good to go!

You should also change the website in /pages.
